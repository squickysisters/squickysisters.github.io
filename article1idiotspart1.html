 <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">What is an incompetent person  ?</h2>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;">  An incompetent person is a person who has no common sence and is 
   unable to function properly in our society. Being surrounded by these people can make your day
  very hard and dreadful. So in this article I will be sharing my top tips on how to
  work with and around incompetent people.</p>
   <p style="font-family:verdana;">The first way to deal with incompetent people is to
 put yourself in their shoes, and think why they might be doing what they are doing.
 This can help you communicate with them because you are now on their level, but what about
 when their level is unreachable? For example if you are in a group project with
 2 great workers and 1 incompetent person (IP), you can moniter the IP for a short amount 
 of time to see what they are doing, hoping that their further actions will make sense,
  but in the chance that it doesn't, try to talk to them. Some things to ask them could be
 "Can you explain your thought process to me?", "You seem confused, do you need help?
    " or "Can you show me what part of the project you are working on?" </p>
 
<p style="font-family:verdana;">Another way to deal with incompetent people is to avoid them
 all together! You may be thinking that it is inevitable to avoid IP but here are some ways to avoid
 them for the most part. The first way to avoid IP is to stay away from Walmart. The second way is to look 
 at behaviors and vibes, do they pass the vibe check? The vibe check, how do you pass it? How do you feel around them?
 Do they make you wanna smash your head in, or do they make you feel like laughing at them? If so,
 you're probably not vibing with them. If you enjoy being around a person, you most likely vibe with them.</p>
